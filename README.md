JSON-OS
============

This is my Fall 2013 undergraduate Operating Systems class project. 

The operating system is written in Javascript and utilizes HTML5 local storage for disk space.

[You can view a live demo of the project here.] (http://sovietaced.github.io/JSON-OS/#)

[The operating system runs programs machine language programs from the 6502 microprocessor as specified here.] (http://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/6502a-instruction-set.pdf)
